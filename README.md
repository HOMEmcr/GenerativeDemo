HOMEmcr - Generative Visuals demo
=================================

A simple demonstration project that shows how we created our example letterforms. Built with Haxe/OpenFL. 

A highly simplified example of the way in which our generative HOME visuals were created. This is the most basic possible demonstration of the idea, and is intended to simply show the flow as something human-readable: this code is currently far too inefficient to actually produce finished pieces! For an optimised open-source implementation please see the work of Roger Alsing, who inspired the project: rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa.

Requires OpenFL to run: https://github.com/openfl/openfl/wiki/Get-Started
